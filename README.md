## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

1. **AI Smart Prioritization Queue (`#/admin`)**:
   - Calculates a live priority score combining keyword urgency ($UrgencyKeywords$), wait time ($WaitHours$), upvote popularity ($Upvotes$), and subsystem hazard factor ($CategoryHazard$).
   - Dynamic sorting from highest urgency down with interactive factors breakdown tooltip and tier badges (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`).

2. **AI Duplicate Detection (`#/complaints/new`)**:
   - Compares selected category, location, and title against existing open campus complaints in real time.
   - Displays a glowing **"Similar complaints found nearby"** banner with an **"Upvote Instead (+1)"** action that boosts the existing ticket and avoids creating duplicates.

3. **CareBot Conversational AI Assistant (`#/chatbot`)**:
   - Step-by-step multi-turn wizard that prompts for Category $\rightarrow$ Campus Location $\rightarrow$ Description $\rightarrow$ Auto-generates the complaint and redirects to live tracking.
   - Instant keyword FAQ replies for Wi-Fi support, ticket status checks, and campus emergency hotlines.
   - Accessible via floating mascot button from every student page.

4. **Live Cross-Role Synchronized Status Tracking (`#/complaints/:id`)**:
   - Vertical timeline (`Submitted` $\rightarrow$ `Acknowledged` $\rightarrow$ `Assigned` $\rightarrow$ `In Progress` $\rightarrow$ `Resolved`) with timestamps and actors.
   - Updates made in Admin or Staff views are immediately synchronized in shared `localStorage` state across all devices and views.

5. **Predictive Recurring Issue Detection (`#/admin/analytics`)**:
   - Automated scanner identifies any campus location + category cluster with $\ge 3$ complaints.
   - Displays high-contrast **"Flagged for Preventive Maintenance"** alert cards with root-cause diagnostics and recommendations.

6. **Hardcopy PDF Audit Report Export**:
   - Real downloadable PDF generated using `jsPDF` and `jspdf-autotable`, summarizing complaint KPIs, recurring failure clusters, and active ticket logs.

7. **Simulated Email Notifications**:
   - `sendEmailNotification()` dispatches toast/snackbar notifications whenever ticket statuses change or technicians are assigned.

8. **Role-Based Client Route Guarding**:
   - Prevents unauthorized access between Student, Admin, and Staff routes.
   - Includes a persistent **Demo Persona Switcher** for instant 1-click testing.
